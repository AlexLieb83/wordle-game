<strong>How It's Made:</strong>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a web app to play the classic Wordle game.      

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

Building this site gave me a lot of practice in CSS and JavaScript. Making the on screen keyboard and making it look good on mobile gave me something that I had to 
continuously tweak until it looked good enough. I also learned how to spin the letters with CSS and JavaScript. I still have on my todo list to add connect the words
to a dictionary API so there are more random choices of words to choose from.
